A top-down puzzle game where you try to escape out from a temple or something like that. You hold a flashlight that allows you to see the game world but it dims and runs out of battery over time. If the battery runs out or you die, it's game over.
There are enemies that will notice your light and attack you (you have a weapon to defend yourself).
